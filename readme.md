Working with Prof Karim Nchare at Vanderbilt-- "Objective: Produce all tables and graphs of Lewis and Margaret's Applied Statistics for Economists in Excel and write a bookdown: https://bookdown.org/."

Initial data he provided is in Excel, when I have to pull data myself it will be RDS or CSV. 

Will be completing the project in RStudio and all relatd charts/tables will be available in an Rmd, not Excel as he described.
